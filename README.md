**Project: Implementing Workflow Ideas Inspired by n8n/Make on Google Colab/Kaggle with Local Models**

**Description:**  
This project focuses on recreating workflows, inspired by templates from n8n or Make, optimized to run completely offline on Google Colab or Kaggle. The aim is to download and utilize machine learning models locally, without relying on external APIs or cloud services.

**Key Steps:**  
1. **Analyze Workflows:** Study the workflows from n8n or Make and identify ideas compatible with offline execution.  
2. **Download Models and Data:**  
   - Select suitable models (e.g., from Hugging Face, pretrained GPT models, or CNNs).  
   - Store all necessary models and data files locally in Colab or Kaggle environments.  
3. **Rewrite Workflows:** Recreate the workflows to integrate with the downloaded models using Python and frameworks like PyTorch or TensorFlow.  
4. **Set Up Local Environment:** Configure Google Colab or Kaggle to install required libraries and prepare the environment for smooth execution of workflows locally.  
5. **Testing:** Thoroughly test the workflows with various scenarios and workloads to ensure stability.  
6. **Optimize Performance:** Fine-tune the code for better efficiency and lower computational resource usage.  
7. **Documentation:** Provide clear documentation and examples to guide users in deploying and customizing the offline workflows.

**Real-World Applications:**  
- Secure and private data analysis using local resources.  
- Integrating and running AI/ML models offline, without network dependencies.  
- Automating complex processes in an adaptable and transparent manner.



# 1. Create Image and post to Facebook Page via Graph Facebook API

## Introduction
This project implements an automated flow to:
1. Generate "image prompts."
2. Create images based on the prompts.
3. Use the Facebook API to upload images to a Facebook page.

## Processing Flow

### 1. Generating Image Prompts
- Image prompts are created based on user inputs or automatically generated using algorithms.
- Elements such as themes, colors, and art styles can be customized.

### 2. Image Generation
- Leverages AI tools or models (e.g., Stable Diffusion) to create images from the prompts.
- Ensures images meet requirements for resolution, quality, and style.

### 3. Uploading to Facebook
- Utilizes Facebook Graph API to upload the generated images.
- Requires API access through an OAuth token.
- Steps involved:
  - Authenticate and obtain permissions.
  - Upload the image to Facebook via the `/PAGE_ID/photos` endpoint.
  - In this case, the page ID is: `61575683403452`.

### Facebook Page Link
